            <p>I was born in Colombia, but I would like to live in every city / town in the world! I have always liked
                music, especially rock because of that I decided to study guitar and since I was 14 I like to learn
                songs from my favorite artists.</p>

            <h2>Profesional Profile</h2>
            <p>I decided to study Systems Engineering because I always liked computers.
                When I started programming with Java, I began to understand the complexity of the matter
                and I saw that there was a lot of potential in the area of software development. That's why, of all
                the branches that software has, I decided on programming, because I like
                solve real life problems and reflect them in code to see the final product
                alive in production! If you want to see more of my experience enter here in my

                I also like to help other people by making donations to the church or any foundation, not only
                to help humans but also animals in situations of abuse, abandonment and disability.</p>

                            Then it became less frequent in my life because I decided to try Skateboarding, which I
